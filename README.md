 P2Pexplorer Server-Less GUI search & social APP

With mobile messaging encryption, privacy, and all other messaging systems for any operating systems known to man 
using a server or even a cloud server to store anything even for a millisecond,that also goes for any type of 
encryption key or algorithm means the world government agencies also have it and within seconds can break into it 
on the fly end of story. 

P2Pexplorer system DOES NOT and will NEVER use any server or the like

To hack our system the only way to copy anything with our p2pexplorer is for a hacker to be sitting next to the 
user whom sends or receives to grab a quick camera pic of the screen once they hit encrypt. 
So pls do not be fooled with companies saying they have the ultimate this or that with any type of security, 
as the only real security one needs is yourself. 

P2pexplorer is a 100% decentralized program. NO ONLINE SERVERS GRABBING AND KEEPING YOUR PRIVATE STUFF.

Once you download p2pexlorer onto your desktop or mobile, you only register with us the once, and by doing so,

all upgrades, and all other apps that we know you all like as we are a peoples company for the people by the people.
